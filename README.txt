Installation Guide -
Final Feature List - Face Tracking, adding text input to be saved a later selected and read out loud by the device using face gesture.

Special Instructions* *In the Special Instructions, please include any information which would be needed to download, configure, and compile the application.

When the application is started and camera permission granted, user should go directly to the interaction manager, I did got to disable the button before the user enters at list one text input and going directly to the face with the list empty tracking can generate bugs or crashes because it is expecting to not be empty.
